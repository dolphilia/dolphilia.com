# Duktape 3.0 release notes

## Release overview

Main changes in this release (see RELEASES.rst for full details):

-   Switch to WTF-8 internal string representation. Matching surrogate
    pairs, both inside ECMAScript strings and in CESU-8 format provided
    by native code, are automatically combined to non-BMP UTF-8
    codepoints; unpaired surrogates remain in CESU-8 style (= WTF-8).
    Invalid WTF-8 byte sequences are replaced with U+FFFD replacements
    to guarantee interned strings are now always valid WTF-8. ECMAScript
    code will still see standard ECMAScript strings where surrogates are
    individual characters. However, native code now sees standard UTF-8
    strings whenever possible (and WTF-8 otherwise), simplifying
    integration with other UTF-8 based APIs.
-   Switch to new internal object property table representation and new
    property handling code.
-   TBD.

## Upgrading from Duktape 2.x

-   If your application deals with UTF-8 and/or CESU-8 string
    representations, the WTF-8 string representation may change or
    eliminate some conversion needs.
-   Source variants have been removed from the distributable, with the
    `src/` directory containing combined sources with default options
    and *without* `#line` directives (previously `src-noline/`). You can
    recreate the removed variants using `tools/configure.py`.
-   TBD.

## More details on WTF-8 changes

-   WTF-8 sanitization, i.e. combining of paired surrogates and using
    U+FFFD replacements for invalid sequences, is applied during the
    string intern check which ensures all string data created by any
    means goes through the sanitization.
-   WTF-8 sanitization uses U+FFFD replacements for invalid byte
    sequences. The replacement policy matches
    <http://unicode.org/review/pr-121.html> (same as TextDecoder).
-   When native code pushes strings, non-BMP codepoints encoded in UTF-8
    style (one combined codepoint) and CESU-8 style (surrogate pair
    encoded as two codepoints) now both result in UTF-8 style being used
    in the internal string representation. Previously one could push
    strings in either form and they would behave slightly differently
    for both native and ECMAScript code.
-   ECMAScript now always sees standard strings consisting of 16-bit
    codepoints, extended codepoint support previously available to
    ECMAScript code has been removed.
-   String.fromCharCode() now always uses standard ToUint16() coercion.
    The option `DUK_USE_NONSTD_STRING_FROMCHARCODE_32BIT` has been
    removed (it allowed non-standard ToUint32() codepoint coercion). The
    standard function String.fromCodePoint() already allows the creation
    of non-BMP characters which now appear as UTF-8 to native code.
