Chimp Tutorial, Line by Line
The pygame examples include a simple program with an interactive fist and a chimpanzee. This was inspired by the annoying flash banner of the early 2000s. This tutorial examines every line of code used in the example.

Sprite Module Introduction
Pygame includes a higher level sprite module to help organize games. The sprite module includes several classes that help manage details found in almost all games types. The Sprite classes are a bit more advanced than the regular pygame modules, and need more understanding to be properly used.

Surfarray Introduction
Pygame used the NumPy python module to allow efficient per pixel effects on images. Using the surface arrays is an advanced feature that allows custom effects and filters. This also examines some of the simple effects from the pygame example, arraydemo.py.

Camera Module Introduction
Pygame, as of 1.9, has a camera module that allows you to capture images, watch live streams, and do some basic computer vision. This tutorial covers those use cases.
