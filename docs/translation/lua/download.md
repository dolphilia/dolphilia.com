## Source

Lua is free software distributed in source code. It may be used for any purpose, including commercial purposes, at absolutely no cost.

All versions are available for download. The current version is Lua 5.4 and its current release is Lua 5.4.6.

## Tools

The main repository of Lua modules is LuaRocks. See also Awesome Lua. Pre-compiled Lua libraries and executables are available at LuaBinaries. The lua-users wiki lists many user-contributed addons for Lua.

## Building

Lua is implemented in pure ANSI C and compiles unmodified in all platforms that have an ANSI C compiler. Lua also compiles cleanly as C++.

Lua is very easy to build and install. There are detailed instructions in the package but here is a simple terminal session that downloads the current release of Lua and builds it in Linux:

```sh
curl -L -R -O https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.6.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.4.6.tar.gz
cd lua-5.4.6
make all test
```

If you have trouble building Lua, read the FAQ.

If you don't have the time or the inclination to compile Lua yourself, get a binary or try the live demo.
