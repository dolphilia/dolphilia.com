## Reference manual

The official definition of the Lua language is its reference manual, which describes the syntax and the semantics of Lua, the standard libraries, and the C API.

The reference manual for Lua 5.4 is available online in English only.

The reference manual for Lua 5.3 is available online in English and Russian.

The reference manual for Lua 5.2 is available online in English, Portuguese, and Polish.

The reference manual for Lua 5.1 is available online in English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and Polish. It is also available as a book in English.

## Technical documentation

For more technical information, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and some old seminar slides. For detailed technical information on specific topics, see our old series of Lua Technical Notes and the wiki at lua-users.org, specially the tutorial. You may also browse the source code.

## Papers

There are many papers and theses related to Lua. Here are the main ones written by the Lua team. See also the LabLua publications.

The main academic paper about Lua discusses the philosophy behind its design:

Lua – an extensible extension language
by R. Ierusalimschy, L. H. de Figueiredo, W. Celes,
Software: Practice & Experience 26 #6 (1996) 635–652. `[doi]`

This paper was awarded the first prize (technological category) in the II Compaq Award for Research and Development in Computer Science in 1997. This award was a joint venture of Compaq Computer in Brazil, the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.
