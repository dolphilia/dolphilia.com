“Brazil's most popular technology export is Lua.”
—in ITPRO (2010)
“As for Lua, it is a high performance scripting language. The high performance was the deciding factor, we needed a language that was fast, fast, fast. Also, it easily integrates to C++.”
—in a Blizzcon 2009 Q&A session
“As a blind programmer, I really enjoy the Lua scripting language. It is one of the most speech friendly languages to read and write with a screen reader. Lua is also very fast, light and portable.”
—Veli-Pekka, about Dolphin scripting (2009)
“The key benefits unique to Lua are the fact that it is amazingly small, fast, and on a technical level a masterpiece. Not every project manages to achieve so much with so little of the dreaded 'bloat'.”
—MatthewWild, in lua-l (2008)
“I just wanted to thank you for this great scripting language! We were previously trying to embed Python but this introduced a lot of problems. After some research I found Lua which is exactly what we were looking for. The library compiled without any modifications and it took me only a few hours to write a Lua-wrapper for our data structure. Everything worked with the first try and no debugging was necessary because it behaved exactly as expected (and as described in the documentation) – amazing!”
—Alex Hartmann, of the Visionaire team (2007)
“What if you could provide a seamlessly integrated, fully dynamic language with a conventional syntax while increasing your application's size by less than 200K on an x86? You can do it with Lua!”
—Keith Fieldhouse, in ONLamp (2006)
“It is easy to see why Lua is rapidly becoming the de facto standard for game scripting.”
—Ian Millington, in Artificial Intelligence for Games, Morgan Kaufmann (2006)
“Before you create yet another configuration file or resource format (and yet another parser to accompany it), try Lua.”
—Martin Streicher, Editor-in-Chief, Linux Magazine, in developerWorks (2006)
“Emma is an application engine which interfaces to Ogre3D and uses Lua for scripting. We have done tests and have found that Lua can warp a 20,000 triangle mesh using a sine function at over 100 fps. No other interpreted language I have ever seen can get close to that.”
—Chris Marrin, in lua-l (2006)
“If you are ever tempted to put scripting into a program, run don't walk to www.lua.org and use it.”
—vze35, in comp.sys.mac.scitech (2006)

—Jack Jansen, in comp.lang.python (1997)
“After reading the Dr. Dobbs article on Lua I was very eager to check it out, and so far it has exceeded my expectations in every way! Its elegance and simplicity astound me. Congratulations on developing such a well-thought out language.”
—Bret Mogilefsky, LucasArts (1997)
“I've been using Lua for a while now and can easily recommend it as an embedded language –much "cleaner" in my opinion than some other options, such as Tcl or Perl. It's also very small/lightweight, one of the fastest around, well documented, and easily bound with C functions.”
—David Bollinger, in rec.games.roguelike.development (1999)
“I've just ported Lua, a dynamic extensible embeddable language, to RISC OS. Thanks to the beautifully ANSI code, Lua was delightfully easy to port, needing only some makefile hacking because of RISC OS oddities.”
—Reuben Thomas, in comp.sys.acorn.announce (1999)

—Jon Kleiser, in comp.sys.mac.programmer.tools (1999)
“About a year ago I was in the position to make suggestions for a scripting language in an embedded application to my ex-employer, with a main focus on immediate availability. I chose Lua, Scheme, Tcl 7.6, Python (in this order), but [would] have loved to see Python in a better rank. Unfortunately the porting effort seemed quite high.”
—Stefan Franke, in comp.lang.python (1999)
“My favourite scripting language is Lua. Lua, written in C, has its roots in Unix, but it's easily ported to Mac OS, Windows xx, BeOS, and others. Lua is small, fast, and very capable.”
—Jon Kleiser, in comp.lang.oberon (1998)
“I originally planned to use Python as my embedded scripting language before turning to Lua. I read the Nutshell book, lurked the mailing list for 4-5 months, downloaded the last 2 versions and wrote several Python scripts. After all of that preparation, I abandoned Python for Lua. Lua is lighter [and] is easier to embed. So, bottom line, if you need what Python's got, go for it, but if you want easy embedding, Lua's the right tool.”
—Ashley Fryer, in comp.ai.games (1998)
“If you're looking for a really small and really cool extension language, have a look at Lua.”
—Lyn Headley, in comp.lang.python (1998)
“If you compare Scheme and Lua for the things you'd want in a game console scripting language, I think Lua will come out ahead. It's smaller, portable, uses less memory, and is faster.”
—Steve Dekorte, in comp.lang.objective-c (1997)
“I recently downloaded the source of both [the] compiler and interpreter [for Lua], and I was very positively surprised by its quality. It compiled on my Mac without as much as a warning, and ran first time! It definitely deserves to be checked out.”
—Mike Fahl, in comp.arch.embedded (1997)
“My advice... save yourself a lot of pain and use Lua. Lua is a small, powerful, efficient scripting language. It was written specifically as an extension language and it's very good. I haven't seen any language (including Python) which is a better choice for embedding. Lua is a truly wonderful language –clean, small, efficient, and free for commercial use. It's very solid code (current version 3.1), used in many industrial applications. It's also well supported. One of the things I like best about it is that I can't think of any way to improve it. If I had decided to write a scripting language for myself, I doubt mine would be as good. For the record, the original Lua code base was generated with flex/bison or lex/yacc, and evolved from there. So, if you're planning on going the flex/bison route, save yourself 3 years of refinement and use Lua.”
—Ashley Fryer, in rec.games.programmer (1998)
“After the article in 'Software, P. & E.' you must have had a lot of responses. Everyone with some knowledge of computer languages will have been struck by the original concepts of the language.”
—W.Boeke, Lucent Technologies, the Netherlands (1996)
“I have read it all, and have gone through the implementation as well. What is amazing to me is what is missing. It feels like Lua is a sort of an updated AWK: it is quite elegant and to the point. Quite an extraordinary piece of work.”
—Dwight VandenBergh (1996)
“Congratulations on Lua. It was exactly what I was looking for, and I've been using it as my primary script language for a month and a half now. It's powerful, small, and very easy to use (and expand upon). Good luck with it. I'd recommend the language to anyone.”
—Joshua Jensen (1996)
“I have been using interpreters in my code since the early 80s for testing and prototyping and to add a macro language...so far [Lua] looks like the best I have seen and I have tried most everything around during that time.”
—Rodney A. Ludwig (1996)
“I downloaded Lua in December, after reading about it in Dr. Dobbs Journal. I found Lua to be remarkably easy to compile and integrate into an application. In less than a week, I have integrated Lua and provided an interface to a specialized database. Originally, I though the task of providing a macro language would take months.”
—Mike Palmer (1997)
“For some time now I've been looking for a portable, compact interpreted or incrementally compiled language to use in various robotic applications. I think Lua is going to be just what I need!”
—Mark Ian Barlow, Non-Linear Control Consultants Ltd (1997)
“I would say that Lua the language is pretty much perfect – at least, very difficult to change without detracting from its elegant design.”
—Francis Burton, University of Glasgow, in lua-l (1997)
“I'm now happily using Lua for the sort of tasks where others often use Perl. I struggled with Perl for a couple of years [...] and never learnt enough to make use of its many cunning bits of magic. Lua was much easier to learn (the entire manual being only 40 pages helps!), and there's no magic, just a simple, small, powerful language, with well-designed standard libraries.”
—Reuben Thomas (2000)
“Learn it at once. It's lovely.”
—Rob Kendrick, in comp.sys.acorn.programmer (2000)
“I'm not so happy with Tcl as language design, and for C I think Lua does a better job than Tcl.”
—Norman Ramsey, in comp.lang.ml (1997)
“I use Lua because I like the language more than C++.”
—Paul Bleisch, in rec.games.programmer (1998)
