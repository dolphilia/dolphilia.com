# Community

## Meeting places

There are several places you can go to meet other people that use Lua. A good starting point is lua-users.org, a collaborative meeting place built for and by Lua users.

One of the focal points of the Lua community is our mailing list, which is very active and friendly; it has many subscribers from all over the world, including several Lua experts and the Lua team.

Other meeting places are stackoverflow, the chat room, Twitter, Mastodon, a Telegram group, and a Discord room. For discussions in Portuguese, join the Lua BR mailing list and visit pt.stackoverflow.

If you want to meet in person, join a user group, find a user group near you, attend a Lua Workshop or a LuaConf.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the community in several ways: answer questions about Lua (in the mailing list, in stackoverflow, and elsewhere), collaborate in the lua-users wiki, answer our survey, add a Lua logo to your web page, tell us about third-party sites related to Lua and papers and theses about Lua, and write tools and libraries for Lua and add them to LuaRocks.

## Supporting Lua

You can help to support the Lua project by buying a book published by Lua.org and by making a donation.

You can help to spread the word about Lua by buying Lua products at Zazzle.

## Workshop

The main goal of the Lua workshop is to allow the Lua community to get together and meet in person and talk about the Lua language, its uses, and its implementation. Another goal is to help spread the word about Lua to industry and academia, taking advantage of the location of the workshop when possible.

If you'd like to organize a Lua workshop, please post a proposal in the mailing list.
