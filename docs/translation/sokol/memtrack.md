sokol_memtrack.h -- memory allocation wrapper to track memory usage
                    of sokol libraries

Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

Optionally provide the following defines with your own implementations:

SOKOL_MEMTRACK_API_DECL - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
SOKOL_API_DECL      - same as SOKOL_MEMTRACK_API_DECL
SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)

If sokol_memtrack.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
including the declaration or implementation:

SOKOL_DLL

USAGE
=====
Just plug the malloc/free wrapper functions into the desc.allocator
struct provided by most sokol header setup functions:

    sg_setup(&(sg_desc){
        //...
        .allocator = {
            .alloc = smemtrack_alloc,
            .free = smemtrack_free,
        }
    });

Then call smemtrack_info() to get information about current number
of allocations and overall allocation size:

    const smemtrack_info_t info = smemtrack_info();
    const int num_allocs = info.num_allocs;
    const int num_bytes = info.num_bytes;

Note the sokol_memtrack.h can only track allocations issued by
the sokol headers, not allocations that happen under the hood
in system libraries.
